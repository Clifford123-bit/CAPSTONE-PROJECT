HOW TO TELL IF A DATA SET CAN BE USED FOR REGRESSION CLASSIFICATION
Task for Regression:The intended variable is either numerical or continuous. A few examples are: forecasting home values,estimating the price of stocks,calculating the temperature,predicting a quantity or a continuous value from input information is the aim.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are three evaluation metrics that are frequently employed in regression projects.
Classification Assignment:
Either a discrete or categorical target variable is used. Identifying emails as spam or not is one example.
determining a patient's likelihood of having a disease.
determining a text's sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
Assigning input instances to several specified classes or groups is the aim.Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC), F1-Score, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall are some of the evaluation measures used in classification tasks.
To ascertain whether a dataset is suitable for regression or classification, try these particular techniques:
Analyse the Variable of Interest:
A regression job appears to be indicated if the target variable is continuous.
A task involving categorization is indicated if the target variable is categorical.
Make the Distribution of the Target Variable Visible:
Plot the target variable as a histogram or density plot to see its distribution as a continuous numerical variable for regression applications.
Plotting a bar chart or count plot will help you see how the target variable's classes and categories are distributed for classification jobs.
Recognise the Business Issue: 
Keep the problem's context in mind while you work to solve it. Are you attempting to categorise instances into separate groups (classification) or predict a continuous value (regression)?
Examine the objectives and problem statement: 
Examine the given problem statement and objectives. Whether the objective is to categorise occurrences into groups or anticipate a continuous value should be made clear. 
Speak with Subject Matter Experts: 
If possible, get advice from stakeholders or domain experts to comprehend the nature of the issue and decide if regression or categorization is more appropriate.

PHASES OF CHRISP
The Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, or CRISP-DM, is a popular methodology for managing machine learning and data mining projects. It offers a methodical framework to direct the whole data mining process, from identifying the business issue to putting the model into use. The CRISP-DM approach is divided into six main sections:

Knowledge of Business:
The project's requirements and objectives are established during this phase from a business standpoint. It include comprehending the business issue, establishing the project's objectives, and evaluating the project's viability. Identifying stakeholders, establishing success criteria, and creating a strategy to meet the project's goals are important activities.
Comprehending Data: 
In order to understand the quality, structure, and substance of the accessible data, the Data Understanding phase concentrates on gathering and examining it. This include gathering data from multiple sources, determining if it is appropriate for analysis, and carrying out preliminary data exploration. Data gathering, data description, data exploration, and data quality evaluation are important responsibilities.
Preparing Data: 


To prepare the data for analysis, it is cleaned, converted, and formatted during the data preparation stage. This include managing outliers, encoding categorical variables, addressing missing values, and carrying out feature engineering. The objective is to produce a tidy and ready-to-use dataset

formodelling. Data cleansing, data integration, data transformation, and feature engineering/selection are important responsibilities.
Modelling: 

Choosing the best modelling strategies and creating machine learning models to solve the business challenge are the tasks of the modelling phase. This include choosing the algorithms, dividing the data into testing and training sets, building the models, and assessing how well they work. To identify the best-performing model, iterative experimentation with various algorithms and model configurations may be carried out. Model building, model evaluation, model tuning, and model selection are important responsibilities.
Assessment: 

The produced models are assessed for performance and suitability for the intended business application during the evaluation phase. This entails evaluating assessment measures, interpreting the findings, and testing the models on hypothetical data. Making ensuring the models fulfil the business objectives and offer useful insights is the aim. Evaluation of the model's performance, interpretation of the findings, and confirmation of the model's efficacy are crucial activities.
Implementation: 


The goal of the deployment phase is to integrate the produced models into decision-making processes or deploy them into operational systems. This entails putting the models into use in real-world settings, setting up deployment procedures, and tracking their effectiveness over time. Deploying the model, integrating it with the current
systems, and creating protocols for continuous maintenance and monitoring are important activities.

ADAVANTAGES OF USING CRISP-DM
Methodical and Organised Approach: CRISP-DM offers a methodical and organised approach to data mining projects, assisting practitioners at every stage of the procedure, from identifying the business issue to putting the model into use. This methodical approach helps keep the project's goals front and centre and guarantees that no crucial phases are missed.

Flexibility: CRISP-DM is adaptable to many project kinds, sectors, and data mining approaches despite its organised foundation. It enables practitioners to modify the methodology to meet the unique demands of every project, taking into account changes in restrictions, goals, and data.

Iterative Nature: Throughout the course of a project, feedback loops and continual improvement are made possible by the iterative and cyclical process that CRISP-DM enables. Through iterations, practitioners can improve their comprehension of the issue, investigate different angles, and modify their plans in light of fresh information. 

Emphasis on Business knowing: A key component of CRISP-DM is knowing the project's goals and business environment. Practitioners may make sure that data mining initiatives are in line with the organization's goals and priorities by concentrating on business understanding early on. This will ultimately produce more meaningful and actionable results.
Extensive Coverage: The approach addresses every important facet of the data mining procedure, such as modelling, implementation, assessment, and interpretation of the data. This thorough covering guarantees that professionals take into account all the factors and duties required to create efficient data mining solutions. 

Collaborative Approach: CRISP-DM promotes communication and cooperation amongst stakeholders, including IT specialists, business users, data scientists, and domain experts. Through the engagement of stakeholders at every stage of the project, professionals can take use of a range of viewpoints and levels of experience to provide superior results.
Reproducibility and Documentation: CRISP-DM places a strong emphasis on documentation at every stage of the project, making sure that all actions, choices, and results are accurately recorded and repeatable. The documentation serves to improve the dependability and credibility of the data mining operations by facilitating knowledge sharing, project transparency, and replication of results. 

Risk management: Throughout the course of the project, the technique incorporates systems for recognising and reducing risks. Through a methodical evaluation of risks and uncertainties, professionals may anticipate problems early on and guarantee the project's success.
